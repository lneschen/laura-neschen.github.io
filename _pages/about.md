======

I am a first-year PhD student in the Morpheo team at Inria, under the supervision of Stefanie Wuhrer and Jean-Sebastien Franco. My work focuses on dynamic 3D reconstruction from multi-view videos. I am particularly interested in differentiable rendering, surface reconstruction and deformation modeling. In my PhD, I am exploring methods for the joint 3D reconstruction and correspondence computation.

I hold a Master's degree in Environmental Sciences from the University of Freiburg in Germany. Before joining the Morpheo team, I worked on academic and industrial projects focused on Computer Vision and Image Processing.
